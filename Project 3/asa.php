			<p>
			Asa began acting at the age of 8, after a talent spotting casting director saw him at his 
			local after school drama club, The Young Actors Theatre in Islington, London. Following on 
			from a couple of small roles in films, he was cast, at 10 years old, as the lead in The 
			Boy in the Striped Pyjamas by Mark Herman. Since then, he has played two amazing titular 
			roles Hugo and Ender's Game as well as other significant roles including Mordred in the 
			BBC's Merlin and Norman in Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang. </p>
			<p>Asa attends school in London, hangs out with his friends playing football on the park, 
			reads a great deal, loves music festivals (New Orleans had a big impact) and plays and 
			writes music at home and with friends at school.</p>
