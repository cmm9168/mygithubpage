			Graff (Harrison Ford) and the International Military are training only the best young minds to 
			find the future Mazer.

			challenges and simulations, distinguishing himself and winning respect amongst his peers. Ender 
			is soon ordained by Graff as the military’s next great hope, resulting in his promotion to 
			Command School.  Once there, he’s trained by Mazer Rackham himself to lead his fellow soldiers 
			into an epic battle that will determine the future of Earth and save the human race.
