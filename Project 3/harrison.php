			<h3>Known For: Indiana Jones, Star Wars The Original Trilogy</h3>

			<p>Harrison Ford was born on July 13, 1942 in Chicago, Illinois. His father had Irish 
			and German ancestry, and his maternal grandparents were Jewish immigrants from the 
			Russian Empire. He was a lackluster student at Maine Township High School East in Park 
			Ridge Illinois (no athletic star, never above a C average). After dropping out of Ripon 
			College in Wisconsin, where he did some acting and later summer stock, he signed a 
			Hollywood contract with Columbia and later Universal. His roles in movies and television 
			("Ironside", "The Virginian") remained secondary and, discouraged, he turned to a career 
			in professional carpentry. He came back big four years later, however, as Bob Falfa in 
			American Graffiti. Four years after that, he hit colossal with the role of Han Solo in 
			Star Wars. Another four years and Ford was Indiana Jones in Raiders of the Lost Ark.</p>
			<p>Four years later and he received Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations for his 
			role as John Book in Witness. All he managed four years after that was his third starring 
			success as Indiana Jones; in fact, many of his earlier successful roles led to sequels 
			as did his more recent portrayal of Jack Ryan in Patriot Games. Another Golden Globe 
			nomination came his way for the part of Dr. Richard Kimble in The Fugitive. He is clearly
			a well-established Hollywood superstar. He also maintains an 800-acre ranch in Jackson Hole, 
			Wyoming.</p>
